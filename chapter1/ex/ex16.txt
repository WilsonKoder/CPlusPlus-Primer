Explain whether the following program fragment is legal:std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;          << " and " << v2;          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;No, it is not legal due to the fact that it has too many semicolons, see the first line and second line.Due to the fact there are line endings there the only way this program would work is if your prefixed the following lines with 'std::cout'similar to the first line.
